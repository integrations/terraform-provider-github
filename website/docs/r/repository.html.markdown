# github_repository

This resource allows you to create and manage repositories within your
GitHub organization or personal account.

~> **Note** When used with GitHub App authentication, even GET requests must have the `contents:write` permission. Without it, the following arguments will be ignored, leading to unexpected behavior and confusing diffs: `allow_merge_commit`, `allow_squash_merge`, `allow_rebase_merge`, `merge_commit_title`, `merge_commit_message`, `squash_merge_commit_title` and `squash_merge_commit_message`.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "github_repository" "example" {
  name        = "example"
  description = "My awesome codebase"

  visibility = "public"

  template {
    owner                = "github"
    repository           = "terraform-template-module"
    include_all_branches = true
  }
}
```

## Example Usage with GitHub Pages Enabled

```hcl
resource "github_repository" "example" {
  name        = "example"
  description = "My awesome web page"

  private = false

  pages {
    source {
      branch = "master"
      path   = "/docs"
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Usage with Repository Forking

```hcl
resource "github_repository" "forked_repo" {
  name         = "forked-repository"
  description  = "This is a fork of another repository"
  fork         = true
  source_owner = "some-org"
  source_repo  = "original-repository"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the repository.

* `description` - (Optional) A description of the repository.

* `homepage_url` - (Optional) URL of a page describing the project.

* `fork` - (Optional) Set to `true` to create a fork of an existing repository. When set to `true`, both `source_owner` and `source_repo` must also be specified.

* `source_owner` - (Optional) The GitHub username or organization that owns the repository being forked. Required when `fork` is `true`.

* `source_repo` - (Optional) The name of the repository to fork. Required when `fork` is `true`.

* `private` - (Optional) Set to `true` to create a private repository.
  Repositories are created as public (e.g. open source) by default.

* `visibility` - (Optional) Can be `public` or `private`. If your organization is associated with an enterprise account using GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub Enterprise Server 2.20+, visibility can also be `internal`. The `visibility` parameter overrides the `private` parameter.

* `has_issues` - (Optional) Set to `true` to enable the GitHub Issues features
  on the repository.

* `has_discussions` - (Optional) Set to `true` to enable GitHub Discussions on the repository. Defaults to `false`.

* `has_projects` - (Optional) Set to `true` to enable the GitHub Projects features on the repository. Per the GitHub [documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create) when in an organization that has disabled repository projects it will default to `false` and will otherwise default to `true`. If you specify `true` when it has been disabled it will return an error.

* `has_wiki` - (Optional) Set to `true` to enable the GitHub Wiki features on
  the repository.

* `is_template` - (Optional) Set to `true` to tell GitHub that this is a template repository.

* `allow_merge_commit` - (Optional) Set to `false` to disable merge commits on the repository.

* `allow_squash_merge` - (Optional) Set to `false` to disable squash merges on the repository.

* `allow_rebase_merge` - (Optional) Set to `false` to disable rebase merges on the repository.

* `allow_auto_merge` - (Optional) Set to `true` to allow auto-merging pull requests on the repository.

* `squash_merge_commit_title` - (Optional) Can be `PR_TITLE` or `COMMIT_OR_PR_TITLE` for a default squash merge commit title. Applicable only if `allow_squash_merge` is `true`.

* `squash_merge_commit_message` - (Optional) Can be `PR_BODY`, `COMMIT_MESSAGES`, or `BLANK` for a default squash merge commit message. Applicable only if `allow_squash_merge` is `true`.

* `merge_commit_title` - Can be `PR_TITLE` or `MERGE_MESSAGE` for a default merge commit title. Applicable only if `allow_merge_commit` is `true`.

* `merge_commit_message` - Can be `PR_BODY`, `PR_TITLE`, or `BLANK` for a default merge commit message. Applicable only if `allow_merge_commit` is `true`.

* `delete_branch_on_merge` - (Optional) Automatically delete head branch after a pull request is merged. Defaults to `false`.

* `web_commit_signoff_required` - (Optional) Require contributors to sign off on web-based commits. See more [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-the-commit-signoff-policy-for-your-repository). Defaults to `false`.

* `has_downloads` - (Optional) Set to `true` to enable the (deprecated) downloads features on the repository.

* `auto_init` - (Optional) Set to `true` to produce an initial commit in the repository.

* `gitignore_template` - (Optional) Use the [name of the template](https://github.com/github/gitignore) without the extension. For example, "Haskell".

* `license_template` - (Optional) Use the [name of the template](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/tree/gh-pages/_licenses) without the extension. For example, "mit" or "mpl-2.0".

* `default_branch` - (Optional) (Deprecated: Use `github_branch_default` resource instead) The name of the default branch of the repository. **NOTE:** This can only be set after a repository has already been created,
and after a correct reference has been created for the target branch inside the repository. This means a user will have to omit this parameter from the
initial repository creation and create the target branch inside of the repository prior to setting this attribute.

* `archived` - (Optional) Specifies if the repository should be archived. Defaults to `false`. **NOTE** Currently, the API does not support unarchiving.

* `archive_on_destroy` - (Optional) Set to `true` to archive the repository instead of deleting on destroy.

* `pages` - (Optional) The repository's GitHub Pages configuration. See [GitHub Pages Configuration](#github-pages-configuration) below for details.

* `security_and_analysis` - (Optional) The repository's [security and analysis](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository) configuration. See [Security and Analysis Configuration](#security-and-analysis-configuration) below for details.

* `topics` - (Optional) The list of topics of the repository.

~> Note: This attribute is not compatible with the `github_repository_topics` resource. Use one of them. `github_repository_topics` is only meant to be used if the repository itself is not handled via terraform, for example if it's only read as a datasource (see [issue #1845](https://github.com/integrations/terraform-provider-github/issues/1845)).

* `template` - (Optional) Use a template repository to create this resource. See [Template Repositories](#template-repositories) below for details.

* `vulnerability_alerts` (Optional) - Set to `true` to enable security alerts for vulnerable dependencies. Enabling requires alerts to be enabled on the owner level. (Note for importing: GitHub enables the alerts on public repos but disables them on private repos by default.) See [GitHub Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-security-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies) for details. Note that vulnerability alerts have not been successfully tested on any GitHub Enterprise instance and may be unavailable in those settings.

* `ignore_vulnerability_alerts_during_read` (Optional) - Set to `true` to not call the vulnerability alerts endpoint so the resource can also be used without admin permissions during read.

* `allow_update_branch` (Optional) - Set to `true` to always suggest updating pull request branches.

### GitHub Pages Configuration

* `source` - (Optional) The source branch and directory for the rendered Pages site. See [GitHub Pages Source](#github-pages-source) below for details.

* `build_type` - (Optional) The type of GitHub Pages site to build. Can be `legacy` or `workflow`. If you use `legacy` as build type you need to set the option `source`.

* `cname` - (Optional) The custom domain for the repository. This can only be set after the repository has been created.

### Security and Analysis Configuration

The `security_and_analysis` block supports the following:

* `advanced_security` - (Optional) The advanced security configuration for the repository. See [Advanced Security Configuration](#advanced-security-configuration) below for details. If a repository's visibility is `public`, advanced security is always enabled and cannot be changed, so this setting cannot be supplied.

* `secret_scanning` - (Optional) The secret scanning configuration for the repository. See [Secret Scanning Configuration](#secret-scanning-configuration) below for details.

* `secret_scanning_push_protection` - (Optional) The secret scanning push protection configuration for the repository. See [Secret Scanning Push Protection Configuration](#secret-scanning-push-protection-configuration) below for details.
