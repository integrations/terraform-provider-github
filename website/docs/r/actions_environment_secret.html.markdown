# github_actions_environment_secret

This resource allows you to create and manage GitHub Actions secrets within your GitHub repository environments.
You must have write access to a repository to use this resource.

Secret values are encrypted using the [Go '/crypto/box' module](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box) which is
interoperable with [libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/). Libsodium is used by GitHub to decrypt secret values. 

For the purposes of security, the contents of the `plaintext_value` field have been marked as `sensitive` to Terraform,
but it is important to note that **this does not hide it from state files**. You should treat state as sensitive always.
It is also advised that you do not store plaintext values in your code but rather populate the `encrypted_value`
using fields from a resource, data source or variable as, while encrypted in state, these will be easily accessible
in your code. See below for an example of this abstraction.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "github_actions_environment_secret" "example_secret" {
  environment       = "example_environment"
  secret_name       = "example_secret_name"
  plaintext_value   = var.some_secret_string
}

resource "github_actions_environment_secret" "example_secret" {
  environment       = "example_environment"
  secret_name       = "example_secret_name"
  encrypted_value   = var.some_encrypted_secret_string
}
```

```hcl
data "github_repository" "repo" {
  full_name = "my-org/repo"
}

resource "github_repository_environment" "repo_environment" {
  repository       = data.github_repository.repo.full_name
  environment      = "example_environment"
}

resource "github_actions_environment_secret" "test_secret" {
  repository       = data.github_repository.repo.full_name
  environment      = github_repository_environment.repo_environment.environment
  secret_name      = "test_secret_name"
  plaintext_value  = "%s"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `repository`              - (Required) Name of the repository.
* `environment`             - (Required) Name of the environment.
* `secret_name`             - (Required) Name of the secret.
* `encrypted_value`         - (Optional) Encrypted value of the secret using the Github public key in Base64 format.
* `plaintext_value`         - (Optional) Plaintext value of the secret to be encrypted.

## Attributes Reference

* `created_at`      - Date of actions_environment_secret creation.
* `updated_at`      - Date of actions_environment_secret update.

## Import

This resource can be imported using an ID made up of the secret name:

```
$ terraform import github_actions_environment_secret.test_secret test_secret_name
```

NOTE: the implementation is limited in that it won't fetch the value of the
`plaintext_value` field when importing. You may need to ignore changes for the
`plaintext_value` as a workaround.
