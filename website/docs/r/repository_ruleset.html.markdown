# github_repository_ruleset (Resource)

Creates a GitHub repository ruleset.

This resource allows you to create and manage rulesets on the repository level. When applied, a new ruleset will be created. When destroyed, that ruleset will be removed.

## Example Usage

```
resource "github_repository" "example" {
  name        = "example"
  description = "Example repository"
}

resource "github_repository_ruleset" "example" {
  name        = "example"
  repository  = github_repository.example.name
  target      = "branch"
  enforcement = "active"

  conditions {
    ref_name {
      include = ["~ALL"]
      exclude = []
    }
  }

  bypass_actors {
    actor_id    = 13473
    actor_type  = "Integration"
    bypass_mode = "always"
  }

  rules {
    creation                = true
    update                  = true
    deletion                = true
    required_linear_history = true
    required_signatures     = true

    required_deployments {
      required_deployment_environments = ["test"]
    }

    
  }
}
```

* `name` - (Required) (String) The name of the ruleset.

* `rules` - (Required) (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Rules within the ruleset. (see [below for nested schema](#rules))

#### Rules ####

The `rules` block supports the following:


* `branch_name_pattern` - (Optional) (Block List, Max: 1) Parameters to be used for the branch_name_pattern rule. This rule only applies to repositories within an enterprise, it cannot be applied to repositories owned by individuals or regular organizations. Conflicts with `tag_name_pattern` as it only applied to rulesets with target `branch`. (see [below for nested schema](#rules.branch_name_pattern))

* `commit_author_email_pattern` - (Optional) (Block List, Max: 1) Parameters to be used for the commit_author_email_pattern rule. This rule only applies to repositories within an enterprise, it cannot be applied to repositories owned by individuals or regular organizations. (see [below for nested schema](#rules.commit_author_email_pattern))

* `commit_message_pattern` - (Optional) (Block List, Max: 1) Parameters to be used for the commit_message_pattern rule. This rule only applies to repositories within an enterprise, it cannot be applied to repositories owned by individuals or regular organizations. (see [below for nested schema](#rules.commit_message_pattern))

* `committer_email_pattern` - (Optional) (Block List, Max: 1) Parameters to be used for the committer_email_pattern rule. This rule only applies to repositories within an enterprise, it cannot be applied to repositories owned by individuals or regular organizations. (see [below for nested schema](#rules.committer_email_pattern))

* `creation` - (Optional) (Boolean) Only allow users with bypass permission to create matching refs.

* `deletion` - (Optional) (Boolean) Only allow users with bypass permissions to delete matching refs.

* `non_fast_forward` - (Optional) (Boolean) Prevent users with push access from force pushing to branches.

* `pull_request` - (Optional) (Block List, Max: 1) Require all commits be made to a non-target branch and submitted via a pull request before they can be merged. (see [below for nested schema](#rules.pull_request))

* `required_deployments` - (Optional) (Block List, Max: 1) Choose which environments must be successfully deployed to before branches can be merged into a branch that matches this rule. (see [below for nested schema](#rules.required_deployments))

* `required_signatures` - (Optional) (Boolean) Commits pushed to matching branches must have verified signatures.

* `required_status_checks` - (Optional) (Block List, Max: 1) Choose which status checks must pass before branches can be merged into a branch that matches this rule. When enabled, commits must first be pushed to another branch, then merged or pushed directly to a branch that matches this rule after status checks have passed. (see [below for nested schema](#rules.required_status_checks))

* `tag_name_pattern` - (Optional) (Block List, Max: 1) Parameters to be used for the tag_name_pattern rule. This rule only applies to repositories within an enterprise, it cannot be applied to repositories owned by individuals or regular organizations. Conflicts with `branch_name_pattern` as it only applied to rulesets with target `tag`. (see [below for nested schema](#rules.tag_name_pattern))

* `update` - (Optional) (Boolean) Only allow users with bypass permission to update matching refs.
  
* `update_allows_fetch_and_merge` - (Optional) (Boolean) Branch can pull changes from its upstream repository. This is only applicable to forked repositories. Requires `update` to be set to `true`. Note: behaviour is affected by a known bug on the GitHub side which may cause issues when using this parameter.
