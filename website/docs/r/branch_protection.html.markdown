# github\_branch\_protection

Protects a GitHub branch.

This resource allows you to configure branch protection for repositories in your organization. When applied, the branch will be protected from forced pushes and deletion. Additional constraints, such as required status checks or restrictions on users and teams, can also be configured.

## Example Usage

```
# Protect the master branch of the foo repository. Additionally, require that
# the "ci/travis" context to be passing and only allow the engineers team merge
# to the branch.
resource "github_branch_protection" "foo_master" {
  repository = "foo"
  branch = "master"
  enforce_admins = true

  required_status_checks {
    strict = false
    contexts = ["ci/travis"]
  }

  required_pull_request_reviews {
    dismiss_stale_reviews = true
    dismissal_users = ["foo-user"]
    dismissal_teams = ["admins", "engineers"]
  }

  restrictions {
    users = ["foo-user"]
    teams = ["engineers"]
  }
