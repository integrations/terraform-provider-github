The organization role and team must both belong to the same organization
on GitHub.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "github_team" "test-team" {
  name     = "test-team"
}

resource "github_team_organization_role_assignment" "test-team-role-assignment" {
  team_slug = github_team.test-team.slug
  role_id   = "8132" # all_repo_read (predefined)
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `team_id` - (Required) The GitHub team id or the GitHub team slug
* `role_id` - (Required) The GitHub Organization role id or role name

## Import

GitHub Team Organization Role Assignment can be imported using an ID made up of `team_id:role_id` or `team_slug:role_id`, e.g.
