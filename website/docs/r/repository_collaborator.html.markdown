# github_repository_collaborator

Provides a GitHub repository collaborator resource.

This resource allows you to add/remove collaborators from repositories in your
organization or personal account. For organization repositories, collaborators can
have explicit (and differing levels of) read, write, or administrator access to 
specific repositories, without giving the user full organization membership. 
For personal repositories, collaborators can only be granted write
(implictly includes read) permission. 

When applied, an invitation will be sent to the user to become a collaborator
on a repository. When destroyed, either the invitation will be cancelled or the
collaborator will be removed from the repository.
