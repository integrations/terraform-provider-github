# github_actions_secret

This resource allows you to create and manage GitHub Actions secrets within your GitHub repositories.
You must have write access to a repository to use this resource.

Secret values are encrypted using the [Go '/crypto/box' module](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box) which is
interoperable with [libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/). Libsodium is used by GitHub to decrypt secret values.

For the purposes of security, the contents of the `plaintext_value` field have been marked as `sensitive` to Terraform,
but it is important to note that **this does not hide it from state files**. You should treat state as sensitive always.
It is also advised that you do not store plaintext values in your code but rather populate the `encrypted_value`
using fields from a resource, data source or variable as, while encrypted in state, these will be easily accessible
in your code. See below for an example of this abstraction.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "github_actions_public_key" "example_public_key" {
  repository = "example_repository"
}

resource "github_actions_secret" "example_secret" {
  repository       = "example_repository"
  secret_name      = "example_secret_name"
  plaintext_value  = var.some_secret_string
}

resource "github_actions_secret" "example_secret" {
  repository       = "example_repository"
  secret_name      = "example_secret_name"
  encrypted_value  = var.some_encrypted_secret_string
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `repository`        - (Required) Name of the repository
* `secret_name`       - (Required) Name of the secret
* `encrypted_value`   - (Optional) Encrypted value of the secret using the GitHub public key in Base64 format.
* `plaintext_value`   - (Optional) Plaintext value of the secret to be encrypted
* `destroy_on_drift`  - (Optional) Boolean indicating whether to recreate the secret if it's modified outside of Terraform. 
                        When `true` (default), Terraform will delete and recreate the secret if it detects external changes. 
                        When `false`, Terraform will acknowledge external changes but not recreate the secret. Defaults to `true`.

## Attributes Reference

* `created_at`      - Date of actions_secret creation.
* `updated_at`      - Date of actions_secret update.

## Import

This resource can be imported using an ID made up of the `repository` and `secret_name`:

```
$ terraform import github_actions_secret.example_secret repository/secret_name
```

NOTE: the implementation is limited in that it won't fetch the value of the
`plaintext_value` or `encrypted_value` fields when importing. You may need to ignore changes for these as a workaround.
