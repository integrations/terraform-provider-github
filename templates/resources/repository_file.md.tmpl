# github_repository_file

This resource allows you to create and manage files within a GitHub repository.

~> **Note:** When a repository is archived, Terraform will skip deletion of repository files to avoid API errors, as archived repositories are read-only. The files will be removed from Terraform state without attempting to delete them from GitHub.

## Example Usage

### Existing Branch

{{tffile "examples/resources/repository_file/example_1.tf"}}

### Auto Created Branch

{{tffile "examples/resources/repository_file/example_2.tf"}}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `repository` - (Required) The repository to create the file in.

- `file` - (Required) The path of the file to manage.

- `content` - (Required) The file content.

- `branch` - (Optional) Git branch (defaults to the repository's default branch). The branch must already exist, it will only be created automatically if 'autocreate_branch' is set true.

- `commit_author` - (Optional) Committer author name to use. **NOTE:** GitHub app users may omit author and email information so GitHub can verify commits as the GitHub App. This maybe useful when a branch protection rule requires signed commits.

- `commit_email` - (Optional) Committer email address to use. **NOTE:** GitHub app users may omit author and email information so GitHub can verify commits as the GitHub App. This may be useful when a branch protection rule requires signed commits.

- `commit_message` - (Optional) The commit message when creating, updating or deleting the managed file.

- `overwrite_on_create` - (Optional) Enable overwriting existing files. If set to `true` it will overwrite an existing file with the same name. If set to `false` it will fail if there is an existing file with the same name.

- `autocreate_branch` - (Optional) **Deprecated** Automatically create the branch if it could not be found. Defaults to false. Subsequent reads if the branch is deleted will occur from 'autocreate_branch_source_branch'. Use the `github_branch` resource instead.

- `autocreate_branch_source_branch` - (Optional) **Deprecated** The branch name to start from, if 'autocreate_branch' is set. Defaults to 'main'. Use the `github_branch` resource instead.

- `autocreate_branch_source_sha` - (Optional) **Deprecated** The commit hash to start from, if 'autocreate_branch' is set. Defaults to the tip of 'autocreate_branch_source_branch'. If provided, 'autocreate_branch_source_branch' is ignored. Use the `github_branch` resource instead.

## Attributes Reference

The following additional attributes are exported:

- `commit_sha` - The SHA of the commit that modified the file.

- `repository_id` - The ID of the repository.

- `sha` - The SHA blob of the file.

- `ref` - The name of the commit/branch/tag.

## Import

Repository files can be imported using a combination of the `repo`, `file` and `branch` or empty branch for the default branch, e.g.

```sh
terraform import github_repository_file.gitignore example:.gitignore:feature-branch
```

and using default branch:

```sh
terraform import github_repository_file.gitignore example:.gitignore:
```
