# github_actions_environment_secret

This resource allows you to create and manage GitHub Actions secrets within your GitHub repository environments. You must have write access to a repository to use this resource.

Secret values are encrypted using the [Go '/crypto/box' module](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box) which is interoperable with [libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/). Libsodium is used by GitHub to decrypt secret values.

For the purposes of security, the contents of the `plaintext_value` field have been marked as `sensitive` to Terraform, but it is important to note that **this does not hide it from state files**. You should treat state as sensitive always. It is also advised that you do not store plaintext values in your code but rather populate the `encrypted_value` using fields from a resource, data source or variable as, while encrypted in state, these will be easily accessible in your code. See below for an example of this abstraction.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/actions_environment_secret/example_1.tf"}}

{{tffile "examples/resources/actions_environment_secret/example_2.tf"}}

## Example Lifecycle Ignore Changes

This resource supports the `lifecycle` `ignore_changes` block. This is for use cases where a secret value is created using a placeholder value and then modified after creation outside the scope of Terraform. This approach ensures only the initial placeholder value is referenced in your code and in the resulting state file.
