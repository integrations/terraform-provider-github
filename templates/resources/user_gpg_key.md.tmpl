# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Provides a GitHub user's GPG key resource.

This resource allows you to add/remove GPG keys from your user account.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/user_gpg_key/example_1.tf"}}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `armored_public_key` - (Required) Your public GPG key, generated in ASCII-armored format. See [Generating a new GPG key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key/) for help on creating a GPG key.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

- `id` - The GitHub ID of the GPG key, e.g. `401586`
- `key_id` - The key ID of the GPG key, e.g. `3262EFF25BA0D270`

## Import

GPG keys are not importable due to the fact that [API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/gpg_keys/#gpg-keys) does not return previously uploaded GPG key.
