# github_issue_label

Provides a GitHub issue label resource.

This resource allows you to create and manage issue labels within your GitHub organization.

Issue labels are keyed off of their "name", so pre-existing issue labels result in a 422 HTTP error if they exist outside of Terraform. Normally this would not be an issue, except new repositories are created with a "default" set of labels, and those labels easily conflict with custom ones.

This resource will first check if the label exists, and then issue an update, otherwise it will create.

~> **Note:** When a repository is archived, Terraform will skip deletion of issue labels to avoid API errors, as archived repositories are read-only. The labels will be removed from Terraform state without attempting to delete them from GitHub.

## Example Usage
