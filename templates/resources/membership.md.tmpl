# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Provides a GitHub membership resource.

This resource allows you to add/remove users from your organization. When applied, an invitation will be sent to the user to become part of the organization. When destroyed, either the invitation will be cancelled or the user will be removed.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/membership/example_1.tf" }}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `username` - (Required) The user to add to the organization.
- `role` - (Optional) The role of the user within the organization. Must be one of `member` or `admin`. Defaults to `member`. `admin` role represents the `owner` role available via GitHub UI.
- `downgrade_on_destroy` - (Optional) Defaults to `false`. If set to true, when this resource is destroyed, the member will not be removed from the organization. Instead, the member's role will be downgraded to 'member'.

## Import

GitHub Membership can be imported using an ID made up of `organization:username`, e.g.

```hcl
$ terraform import github_membership.member hashicorp:someuser
```
