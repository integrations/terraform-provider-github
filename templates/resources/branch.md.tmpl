# github\_branch

This resource allows you to create and manage branches within your repository.

Additional constraints can be applied to ensure your branch is created from another branch or commit.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/branch/example_1.tf"}}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `repository` - (Required) The GitHub repository name.

- `branch` - (Required) The repository branch to create.

- `source_branch` - (Optional) The branch name to start from. Defaults to `main`.

- `source_sha` - (Optional) The commit hash to start from. Defaults to the tip of `source_branch`. If provided, `source_branch` is ignored.

## Attribute Reference

The following additional attributes are exported:

- `source_sha` - A string storing the commit this branch was started from. Not populated when imported.

- `etag` - An etag representing the Branch object.

- `ref` - A string representing a branch reference, in the form of `refs/heads/<branch>`.

- `sha` - A string storing the reference's `HEAD` commit's SHA1.

## Import

GitHub Branch can be imported using an ID made up of `repository:branch`, e.g.

```sh
$ terraform import github_branch.terraform terraform:main
```

Importing github branch into an instance object (when using a for each block to manage multiple branches)

```sh
$ terraform import github_branch.terraform["terraform"] terraform:main
```

Optionally, a source branch may be specified using an ID of `repository:branch:source_branch`. This is useful for importing branches that do not branch directly off main.

```sh
$ terraform import github_branch.terraform terraform:feature-branch:dev
```
