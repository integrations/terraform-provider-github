# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Creates a GitHub organization ruleset.

This resource allows you to create and manage rulesets on the organization level. When applied, a new ruleset will be created. When destroyed, that ruleset will be removed.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/organization_ruleset/example_1.tf" }}

## Argument Reference

- `enforcement` - (Required) (String) Possible values for Enforcement are `disabled`, `active`, `evaluate`. Note: `evaluate` is currently only supported for owners of type `organization`.

- `name` - (Required) (String) The name of the ruleset.

- `rules` - (Required) (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Rules within the ruleset. (see [below for nested schema](#rules))

- `target` - (Required) (String) Possible values are `branch`, `tag` and `push`.

- `bypass_actors` - (Optional) (Block List) The actors that can bypass the rules in this ruleset. (see [below for nested schema](#bypass_actors))

- `conditions` - (Optional) (Block List, Max: 1) Parameters for an organization ruleset condition. For `branch` and `tag` targets, `ref_name` is required alongside one of `repository_name` or `repository_id`. For `push` targets, `ref_name` must NOT be set - only `repository_name` or `repository_id` should be used. (see [below for nested schema](#conditions))

### Rules

The `rules` block supports the following:

~> **Note:*- Rules are target-specific. `branch` and `tag` targets support rules like `creation`, `deletion`, `pull_request`, `required_status_checks`, etc. `push` targets only support `file_path_restriction`, `max_file_size`, `max_file_path_length`, and `file_extension_restriction`. Using the wrong rules for a target will result in a validation error.

- `branch_name_pattern` - (Optional) (Block List, Max: 1) Parameters to be used for the branch_name_pattern rule. This rule only applies to repositories within an enterprise, it cannot be applied to repositories owned by individuals or regular organizations. Conflicts with `tag_name_pattern` as it only applies to rulesets with target `branch`. (see [below for nested schema](#rulesbranch_name_pattern))

- `commit_author_email_pattern` - (Optional) (Block List, Max: 1) Parameters to be used for the commit_author_email_pattern rule. This rule only applies to repositories within an enterprise, it cannot be applied to repositories owned by individuals or regular organizations. (see [below for nested schema](#rulescommit_author_email_pattern))

- `commit_message_pattern` - (Optional) (Block List, Max: 1) Parameters to be used for the commit_message_pattern rule. This rule only applies to repositories within an enterprise, it cannot be applied to repositories owned by individuals or regular organizations. (see [below for nested schema](#rulescommit_message_pattern))

- `committer_email_pattern` - (Optional) (Block List, Max: 1) Parameters to be used for the committer_email_pattern rule. This rule only applies to repositories within an enterprise, it cannot be applied to repositories owned by individuals or regular organizations. (see [below for nested schema](#rulescommitter_email_pattern))
